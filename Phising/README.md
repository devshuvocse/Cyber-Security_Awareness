🛑 EDUCATIONAL PHISHING DEMO: Credential Harvesting Simulation⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING: FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLYThis repository contains code designed for cybersecurity workshops and ethical testing environments only. The purpose of this project is to simulate a basic credential harvesting attack (Phishing) to educate users on how these attacks work and how to recognize them.DO NOT use this code for any malicious, illegal, or unauthorized activity. The author and maintainer of this repository assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this code.🎯 Project GoalThis project simulates a highly effective phishing attempt by cloning the look and feel of a major social media site (Facebook in this case). When a user inputs their username and password into the fake login form, the Python server running in the backend captures and prints the credentials to the console, instead of logging the user in legitimately.This demonstrates the core mechanism of a Credential Harvesting attack.📁 Files Includedphishing_demo_server.py (The Server)A simple Python script using the Flask framework.Contains the server logic and the HTML content as a multi-line string.Function: Captures username and password submitted via the login form and prints them to the server console.index.html (The Frontend Mockup)A standalone HTML file demonstrating the visual fidelity of the mock login page.It uses CSS to perfectly mimic the target website's header and a convincing social media post lure.Note: In the Python file, this HTML is served dynamically.🚀 How to Run the Demo (Local Environment)This demonstration requires Python and Flask installed on your machine.1. SetupInstall Flask using pip:pip install Flask
2. Run the ServerExecute the Python script:python phishing_demo_server.py
3. Demo StepsThe server will start, usually on http://0.0.0.0:5000/.For Workshop: Find your computer's local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.5). Have participants on the same network open http://[YOUR_IP_ADDRESS]:5000/ in their browser.Ask a participant to attempt to "log in" by entering any dummy email and password into the header form.Immediately, observe your terminal/console. The captured credentials will be printed clearly, demonstrating the attack in real-time.🤝 Ethical ResponsibilityRemember to always seek explicit permission before testing this on any network or device you do not own or administer. Use this tool responsibly to enhance security awareness, not to compromise security.
